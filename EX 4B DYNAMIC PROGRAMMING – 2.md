# EX 4B DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 2
## DATE:
## AIM:
To find longest common substring or subword (LCW) of two strings using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach.



## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Input two strings A and B
3. Initialize a variable ans to 0 (this will store the maximum length found)

4. For each index a from 0 to len(A) - 1:
   
       a. For each index b from 0 to len(B) - 1:
   
       i. Initialize k = 0
   
       ii. While both (a + k) < len(A) and (b + k) < len(B), and A[a + k] == B[b + k]:
   
       iii.Increment k by 1
   
       iv. Update ans as the maximum of ans and k

5.Print the value of ans

6.End

        and st1[a + k] == st2[b + k]):
                k = k + 1;
            ans = max(ans, k);
  return ans;

if __name__ == '__main__':
 
    A = input()
    B = input()
    i = len(A)
    j = len(B)
    print('Length of Longest Common Substring is', LongComSubS(A, B))

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the longest common substring or subword (LCW) of two strings using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach.
